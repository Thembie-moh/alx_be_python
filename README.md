# Introduction to Python\nIn this project I was expected to define Python and understand what its key characteristics are as a high level programming language.\n In addition, I was supposed to install Python on my system and set up a development environment to start writting python code.\n Finally, I had to explain the importance of indentation in Python code and how it contributes to code readability by writting basic Python code following proper syntax guidelines.\nTask Objectives\n-To practice basic arithmetic operations in Python by performing predefined calculations.\n - Apply basic Python arithmetic operations and variable assignments to calculate the simple interest on a given principal amount, rate of interest, and time.\n - Use basic Python arithmetic operations and variable assignments to calculate the area of a rectangle using its length and width.\n - Demonstrate understanding of variable assignments and arithmetic operations by converting a given number of hours into seconds.\n - Practice receiving user input in Python and perform a simple arithmetic operation to calculate the user’s age in a future year.\n -  Use user input, variables, and arithmetic operations to calculate and provide feedback on a user’s monthly savings and potential future savings without applying conditional statements.
