# Introduction to Python

In this project, I was expected to define Python and understand what its key characteristics are as a high-level programming language.

In addition, I was supposed to install Python on my system and set up a development environment to start writing Python code.

Finally, I had to explain the importance of indentation in Python code and how it contributes to code readability by writing basic Python code following proper syntax guidelines.
